  bio="Hi, I’m James. At NewsFlashPro, I cover all kinds of stories — big, small, local, or national. I enjoy following leads, asking questions, and figuring out the details that make a story come alive. Every story has layers, and I try to uncover them in a way readers can actually connect with."
  experience="I began reporting in my own community, talking to people, going to events, and observing what was happening around me. Those experiences taught me to listen closely, notice the small things, and look at every story from different perspectives. Sometimes the tiniest detail can completely change how a story is told."
  personalLife="Outside work, I like quiet walks, sitting in coffee shops to read or jot down ideas, and watching documentaries. Even simple everyday moments often inspire stories — a conversation with a neighbor, a street scene, or something I notice while walking around town."
