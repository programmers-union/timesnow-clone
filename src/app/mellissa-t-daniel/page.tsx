  bio="Hi, I'm Melissa. At NewsFlashPro, I write about whatever stories need telling â€” big or small, local or national. I love following leads, talking to people, and figuring out the story behind the headlines. For me, the best part of reporting is helping readers understand what's really happening and why it matters."
  experience="I started in community reporting, going to town meetings, chatting with neighbors, and covering events that most people might overlook. Those experiences taught me to listen carefully, ask the right questions, and dig a little deeper to find the real story."
  personalLife="Outside of work, I spend time exploring farmers' markets, sketching little scenes I see around town, or just talking with people about their lives and what's important to them. Those moments often give me ideas for stories or help me see a familiar topic in a new way."
